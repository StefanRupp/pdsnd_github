### Description
To get the statistics, you need to start the program and choose a city.
If you want to explore everything that is included in the file, you can type in "all" at the month and day filter.
But if you only want to see the data from a specific month or day, you can set up these filters.

After setting filters, you can have a look at the raw data if you want before you get the statistics 
to the following topics:

1. Statistics on the most frequent times of travel
2. Statistics on the most popular stations and trip
3. Statistics on the total and average trip duration
4. Statistics on bikeshare users
 
After printing the statistics, the program will ask you to restart again at choosing a new city

### Files and Programs used
The following csv-files are used:

* **chicago.csv**
